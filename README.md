# Features Selection in Machine Learning

This project shows how to select important features using the **Chi-Squared Test** in machine learning.

## What is Feature Selection?

Feature selection helps pick the most useful data columns (features) from your dataset. This makes the model:

- Faster  
- Easier to understand   
- Sometimes more accurate
  
##  What is Chi-Squared Test?

Chi-Squared Test is a statistical method used to check if two variables (like a feature and the target) are related. It helps us choose the best features for prediction.

##  What’s in this Project?

- How to use Chi-Squared Test to select features  
- Easy code with comments
